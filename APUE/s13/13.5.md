# readv/writev
***

&emsp;&emsp;
readv 和 writev 能够将分散的多块缓冲区一次性读出和写入，而仅仅是使用一次系统调用。

    #include <sys/uio.h>
    
    /* Structure for scatter/gather I/O.  */
    struct iovec {
        void *iov_base;     /* Pointer to data.  */
        size_t iov_len;     /* Length of data.  */
    };
    
    /* Read data from file descriptor FD, and put the result in the
       buffers described by IOVEC, which is a vector of COUNT `struct iovec's.
       The buffers are filled in the order specified.
       Operates just like `read' (see <unistd.h>) except that data are
       put in IOVEC instead of a contiguous buffer.
    
       This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
       __THROW.  */
    extern ssize_t readv (int __fd, __const struct iovec *__iovec, int __count);
    
    /* Write data pointed by the buffers described by IOVEC, which
       is a vector of COUNT `struct iovec's, to file descriptor FD.
       The data is written in the order specified.
       Operates just like `write' (see <unistd.h>) except that the data
       are taken from IOVEC instead of a contiguous buffer.
    
       This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
       __THROW.  */
    extern ssize_t writev (int __fd, __const struct iovec *__iovec, int __count);

读取时首先填满第一个缓冲区，然后填写第二个缓冲区。
写入时也是按照 iovec 的顺序来写入。
